Hello! My name is Christian Reyes and I am a second year student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. 

I'm interested in creating altruistic technologies and using them to combat digital inequalities. I'm currently learning how to
build web applications using the ReactJS library, and have worked on a couple projects so far which were all deployed using Netlify.
